# The-31-Days-Challange.-Becoming-a-security-Analyst.-
This repository serves as a comprehensive resource documenting the key concepts and practical applications explored this week in preparation for a role as a Security Analyst.
The primary focus of this week's study is the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model, a foundational framework for understanding network communications and security protocols.

<h1>Objectives</h1>
1. To provide a detailed overview of the OSI model and its seven layers.<BR>
2. To illustrate the role of each layer in network security.<BR>
3. To demonstrate practical applications of the OSI model in security analysis.

<BR>Overview of the OSI Model Layers

Layer 7: Application Layer The application layer is the OSI layer closest to the end user, which means both the user and the application layer interact directly with the software application. This layer provides the interface between the applications used to communicate and the underlying network services.

Layer 6: Presentation Layer The presentation layer manages the presentation of data to the application layer, handling data format, encryption, and decryption. It ensures that data is presented in a format that the receiving application can understand.

Layer 5. Session Layer The session layer controls the dialogues (ports and sessions) between computers. It establishes, manages, and terminates connections between applications. Session layer implementations include managing user login and logout procedures
